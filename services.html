                        <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">DEPENDENT PROGRAMING</h2>
                        <p class="mb-5">In computer science and logic, a dependent type is a type whose definition depends on a value. It is an overlapping feature of type theory and type systems. In intuitionistic type theory, dependent types are used to encode logic's quantifiers like "for all" and "there exists". In functional programming languages like Agda, ATS, Coq, F*, Epigram, and Idris, dependent types may help reduce bugs by enabling the programmer to assign types that further restrain the set of possible implementations.</p>
                        <P>Two common examples of dependent types are dependent functions and dependent pairs. The return type of a dependent function may depend on the value (not just type) of one of its arguments. For instance, a function that takes a positive integer {\displaystyle n}n may return an array of length {\displaystyle n}n, where the array length is part of the type of the array. (Note that this is different from polymorphism and generic programming, both of which include the type as an argument.) A dependent pair may have a second value of which the type depends on the first value. Sticking with the array example, a dependent pair may be used to pair an array with its length in a type-safe way.</P> 
                        <P>Dependent types add complexity to a type system. Deciding the equality of dependent types in a program may require computations. If arbitrary values are allowed in dependent types, then deciding type equality may involve deciding whether two arbitrary programs produce the same result; hence type checking may become undecidable.</P>

                        <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">NETWORK PROGRAMING</h2>   
                        <p class="mb-5">Python plays an essential role in network programming. The standard library of Python has full support for network protocols, encoding, and decoding of data and other networking concepts, and it is simpler to write network programs in Python than that of C++.</p>What Are Sockets?</P>
                            <P>A socket is a link between two applications that can communicate with one another (either locally on a single machine or remotely between two machines in separate locations).
                            
                            Basically, sockets act as a communication link between two entities, i.e. a server and a client. A server will give out information being requested by a client. For example, when you visited this page, the browser created a socket and connected to the server.</p>

                            <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">SYMBOLIC PROGRAMMING</h2>   
                            <p class="mb-5">In computer science, a symbolic language is a language that uses characters or symbols to represent concepts, such as mathematical operations and the entities (or operands) on which these operations are performed. Modern programming languages use symbols to represent concepts and/or data and are therefore, examples of symbolic languages. In computer programming, symbolic programming is a programming paradigm in which the program can manipulate its own formulas and program components as if they were plain data.

                                Through symbolic programming, complex processes can be developed that build other more intricate processes by combining smaller units of logic or functionality. Thus, such programs can effectively modify themselves and appear to "learn", which makes them better suited for applications such as artificial intelligence, expert systems, natural language processing, and computer games.</p>

                                <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">AUTOMATA PROGRAMMING</h2>
                                <p class="mb-5">Automata-based programming is a programming paradigm in which the program or part of it is thought of as a model of a finite-state machine (FSM) or any other (often more complicated) formal automaton (see automata theory). Sometimes a potentially infinite set of possible states is introduced, and such a set can have a complicated structure, not just an enumeration.

                                    Finite-state machine-based programming is generally the same, but, formally speaking, does not cover all possible variants, as FSM stands for finite-state machine, and automata-based programming does not necessarily employ FSMs in the strict sense.
                                    
                                    <p class="mb-5">The following properties are key indicators for automata-based programming:</p>
                                    
                                    1)   The time period of the program's execution is clearly separated down to the automaton steps. Each step is effectively an execution of a code section (same for all the steps) which has a single entry point. That section might be divided down to subsections to be executed depending on different states, although this is not necessary.
                                    <BR></BR>
                                    <p class="mb-5">2)    Any communication between the automaton steps is only possible via the explicitly noted set of variables named the automaton state. Between any two steps, the program cannot have implicit components of its state, such as local variables' values, return addresses, the current instruction pointer, etc. That is, the state of the whole program, taken at any two moments of entering an automaton step, can only differ in the values of the variables being considered as the automaton state.</p>

                                <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">GRAPHCIAL USER INTERFACE(GUI)</h2>
                                <p class="mb-5">Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard library. Tkinter has several strengths. It’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Visual elements are rendered using native operating system elements, so applications built with Tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run.

                                    Although Tkinter is considered the de-facto Python GUI framework, it’s not without criticism. One notable criticism is that GUIs built with Tkinter look outdated. If you want a shiny, modern interface, then Tkinter may not be what you’re looking for.
                                    
                                    However, Tkinter is lightweight and relatively painless to use compared to other frameworks. This makes it a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, and the top priority is to build something that’s functional and cross-platform quickly. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.</p>
