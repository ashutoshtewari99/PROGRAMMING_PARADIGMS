                        <p class="mb-5">Structured Programming Approach, as the word suggests, can be defined as a programming approach in which the program is made as a single structure. It means that the code will execute the instruction by instruction one after the other. It doesn’t support the possibility of jumping from one instruction to some other with the help of any statement like GOTO, etc. Therefore, the instructions in this approach will be executed in a serial and structured manner.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-5">The structured program consists of well structured and separated modules. But the entry and exit in a Structured program is a single-time event. It means that the program uses single-entry and single-exit elements. Therefore a structured program is well maintained, neat and clean program. This is the reason why the Structured Programming Approach is well accepted in the programming world.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING</h2>   
                        <p class="mb-5">Procedural Programming may be the first programming paradigm that a new developer will learn. Fundamentally, the procedural code is the one that directly instructs a device on how to finish a task in logical steps. This paradigm uses a linear top-down approach and treats data and procedures as two different entities. Based on the concept of a procedure call, Procedural Programming divides the program into procedures, which are also known as routines or functions, simply containing a series of steps to be carried out.

                            Simply put, Procedural Programming involves writing down a list of instructions to tell the computer what it should do step-by-step to finish the task at hand.</p>               
                            <div class="iframe-container">

                            <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING</h2>   
                            <p class="mb-5">Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

                                For instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.
                                
                                Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things like cars as well as relations between things like companies and employees, students and teachers, etc. OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.
                                
                                Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially in order to complete a task.
                                
                                The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.</p>

                                <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">EVENT DRIVEN PROGRAMMING</h2>
                                <p class="mb-5">An event-driven program is also known as an event-driven application is a program designed to react to specific kinds of user input such as clicks on a command button, choosing a choice from a drop-down list, adding an entry into a text box, or other kinds of user events.
                                    Event-driven programming separates event-processing logic from the rest of a program’s code. The event-driven approach contrasts with batch processing. Because event-driven programming is an approach rather than a type of language, event-driven apps can be created in any programming language. Depending on the specific application, event-driven processing can improve responsiveness, throughput and flexibility.</p>

                                <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">DECLERATIVE PROGRAMMING</h2>
                                <p class="mb-5">Declarative Programming Languages focus on on describing what should be computed - and avoid mentioning how that computation should be performed. In practice this means avoiding expressions of control flow: loops and conditional statements are removed and replaced with higher level constructs that describe the logic of what needs to be computed.

                                    The usual example of a declarative programming language is SQL. It lets you define what data you want computed - and translates that efficiently onto the database schema. This lets you avoid having to specify details of how to execute the query, and instead lets the query optimizer figure out the best index and query plan on a case by case basis.
                                    
                                    Python isn't a pure Declarative Language - but the same flexibility that contributes to its sluggish speed can be be leveraged to create Domain Specific API's that use the same principles. I thought it would be kind of interesting to look at a couple specific examples of how this plays out.</p>
