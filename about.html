                        <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">IMPERATIVE PROGRAMING</h2>
                        <p class="mb-5">In imperative programming, you focus on how a program operates. Programs change state information as needed in order to achieve a goal. Computation is performed as a direct change to program state. This style is especially useful when manipulating data structures and produces elegant yet simple code. Python fully implements this paradigm. The imperative programming paradigm uses the imperative mood of natural language to express directions. It executes commands in a step-by-step manner, just like a series of verbal commands. Following the "how-to-solve" approach, it makes direct changes to the state of the program; hence it is also called the stateful programming model. Using the imperative programming paradigm, you can quickly write very simple yet elegant code, and it is super-handy for tasks that involve data manipulation. Owing to its comparatively slower and sequential execution strategy, it cannot be used for complex or parallel computations.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">PARALLEL PROGRAMING</h2>   
                        <p class="mb-5">Parallel programming in Python is a bit tricky as compared to languages such as C/C++ and Java, where one can write parallel programs by executing multiple threads. Python interpreter was designed with simplicity in mind and with the notion that multithreading is tricky and dangerous. The default python(CPython) interpreter has a thread-safe mechanism, the Global interpreter lock.Python is restricted to a single OS thread; therefore, it cannot make use of the multiple cores and processors available on modern hardware. So throwing some threads into the program will not result in faster performance, since the threads essentially run in serial. The actual overhead of thread creation, synchronization and termination will actually slow down the program. This problem exists only in CPython, not in Jython or IronPython.Instead of threads, Python programmers should use the multiprocessing library to easily create and coordinate multiple Python processes. Each one is scheduled independently on the CPU by the OS. Multiprocessing is an invaluable library for writing parallel programs in python.</p>

                            <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">CONCURRENT PROGRAMING</h2>   
                            <p class="mb-5">Concurrency is often misunderstood and mistaken for parallelism. That's not the case. Concurrency implies scheduling independent code to be executed in a cooperative manner. Take advantage of the fact that a piece of code is waiting on I/O operations, and during that time run a different but independent part of the code.

                                In Python, we can achieve lightweight concurrent behaviour via greenlets. From a parallelization perspective, using threads or greenlets is equivalent because neither of them runs in parallel. Greenlets are even less expensive to create than threads. Because of that, greenlets are heavily used for performing a huge number of simple I/O tasks, like the ones usually found in networking and web servers.</p>

                                <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMING</h2>
                                <p class="mb-5">Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve“. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables. Functional languages are declarative languages, they tell the computer what result they want. This is usually contrasted with imperative languages that tell the computer what steps to take to solve a problem. Python is usually coded in an imperative way but can use the declarative style if necessary.

                                    Some of Python's features were influenced by Haskell, a purely functional programming language. If you'd like functions to be pure, then do not change the value of the input or any data that exists outside the function's scope.

                                    This makes the function we write much easier to test. As it does not change the state of any variable, we are guaranteed to get the same output every time we run the function with the same input.</p>

                                <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title">LOGICAL PROGRAMING</h2>
                                <p class="mb-5">Logic programming is a computer programming paradigm in which program statements express facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic. Rules are written as logical clauses with a head and a body; for instance, "H is true if B1, B2, and B3 are true." Facts are expressed similar to rules, but without a body; for instance, "H is true."

                                    Some logic programming languages, such as Datalog and ASP (Answer Set Programming), are purely declarative. They allow for statements about what the program should accomplish, with no explicit step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Others, such as Prolog, are a combination of declarative and imperative. They may also include procedural statements, such as "To solve H, solve B1, B2, and B3." Python Logic programming is a programming paradigm that sees computation as automatic reasoning over a database of knowledge made of facts and rules. It is a way of programming and is based on formal logic. A program in such a language is a set of sentences, in logical form, one that expresses facts and rules about a problem domain. Among others, Datalog is one such major logic programming language family. </p>
